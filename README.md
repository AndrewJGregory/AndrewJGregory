Hi there ðŸ‘‹! This is my personal GitHub account that hasn't been updated in a few years. The pinned projects below are still interesting, but not as relevant to me anymore. My work GitHub is [andrew-gregory-genedx](https://github.com/andrew-gregory-genedx), which has only contributed to private repos so it is quite boring to see.
